# API Testing with Bruno

API Testing Practivce Project with Bruno 

Why I Use Bruno Instead of Postman ðŸš€

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

While Postman is great, I prefer Bruno for API development because it's super fast and lightweight. Bruno's open-source nature allows for customization and contributions, and its user-friendly interface makes API testing a breeze. Plus, the collaboration features and extensive documentation make teamwork and troubleshooting easier. Give Bruno a try, and you might love it too! ðŸ˜Š
